A random colour code is created for which the player must guess, and they will be given a finite number of attempts based on difficulty to guess this colour code.

The player enters their guess using the colour input buttons red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.

Each time the player selects a colour code button, that colour is put into the next empty space in their guess

Once a player has entered all the colours for their first guess, they are provided with a score which indicates how close their guess is to the actual code. This score displayed on the grid next to their guess.

For each correct colour that the player has put in the right place, the score grid displays a black circle with two tick marks

For each correct colour that the player does not put in the right place, the score grid displays a white circle with one tick mark.

For each incorrect colour the player guessed, an empty space is displayed on the score.

Players are provided with a score for each of their guesses, but they are not told which score icons relate to each colour in the code.
